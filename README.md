# wiki-to-philosophy

This repo is inspired from [Benjamin Bini's implementation](https://github.com/BenjaminBini/getting-to-philosophy) of 
[Getting to philosophy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Getting_to_Philosophy) game: if you go to any page on 
Wikipedia and keep clicking on the first link of the page (ignoring meta links, links between parenthesis and the ones 
in italic), you will eventually reach the [Philosophy article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy).
